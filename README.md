- CYBERSECURITY BENCHMARK
    - A set of synthesized and real-life prompts for user query binary classification: malicious/non-malicious prompts. See the data snippet at [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hse-llm/prompt-injections) 
- GRAMMATICALITY JUDGEMENT BENCHMARK
    - A set of grammatical and their non-grammatical variations for binary classification and assessing the model linguistic competernce. See the data snippet at [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/missvector/multi-wiki-grammar)
- CONTRADICTIONS BENCHMARK
